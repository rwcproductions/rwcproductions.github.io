				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ballad of Dorkus At The Back was a tale I found in my dad&rsquo;s old paper D&amp;D archives on paper that shows that it is quite old - and showed that it was a photocopy of a photocopy. It was written by a friend of a friend, a DM of some skill that has become renowned since his passing many years ago, by the name of Dave &lt;last name having to be dredged out of the memory of my dad&gt;. The story is of a D&amp;D game that went wrong because one player chose to play with the equivalent of &ldquo;Cheat-mode&rdquo; on.</p>
<h2 id="dorkus-at-the-back">Dorkus At The Back</h2>
<div style="-moz-column-count: 3; -moz-column-gap: 1em; -moz-column-rule: 1px solid black; -webkit-column-count: 3; -webkit-column-gap: 1em; -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid black;">
<p>The outlook was not brilliant<br />
as the Party trudged along;<br />
&lsquo;Tween Knolls and Trolls, and bad Die Rolls,<br />
everything was wrong.</p>
<p>When Dis, and Dat, and Bert all died,<br />
and the Paladin did the same;<br />
A pall of sullen silence qwelled<br />
the players in the game.</p>
<p>A straggling few dejected stood,<br />
in deep despair the rest,<br />
Clinging to the hope that lies eternal<br />
in the human breast.</p>
<p>They thought if only&quot;Dork-the-Mage&quot;<br />
were played with greater skill,<br />
The stalwarts might get out alive,<br />
their chances now, were nil.</p>
<p>For Dorkus-the-Mage was played by John,<br />
a creature many dread,<br />
Who loved arguing past all reason<br />
every word the GM said.</p>
<p>For John knew the Player&rsquo;s Handbook,<br />
and the DMG by heart,<br />
Pontificating Gyrax&rsquo;s gospel<br />
while he usurped the GM&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d brag on his minus 12 AC,<br />
and magic things he owned,<br />
Though most of them were acquired<br />
when he played at home, alone.</p>
<p>He extolled upon his hit points vast,<br />
and abilities he&rsquo;d claim,<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;God-Grant&rsquo;,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d proudly say<br />
without referencing God&rsquo;s Name.</p>
<p>So on the sullen gathering<br />
grim melancholy stood,<br />
For they knew there was little chance<br />
of Dorkus doing any good.</p>
<p>Ah! but Cutter preceded Dorkus,<br />
and he a Fighter true.<br />
As did O&rsquo;Magosh the Cleric,<br />
and *<strong>*___**</strong>, a Warrior, too.</p>
<p>Followed by mighty Dorkus,<br />
boldly quipping from the back,<br />
With his hit points still unsullied<br />
and all his spells intact.</p>
<p>In trepidation the party<br />
moved cautiously down the hall<br />
And came at last to an Oaken Door<br />
in the stone moss-covered wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s check for traps,&rdquo; the Cleric quoth,<br />
&ldquo;since we don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s inside.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;To Hell with that, I&rsquo;ve got a spell<br />
that&rsquo;ll blow it open wide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;M the Party Leader,&rdquo; announced the mage,<br />
&ldquo;the plan is MINE to tell,&quot;<br />
&ldquo;And the pick of what we find in there!&quot;<br />
then Dorkus cast his spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who anointed you the Leader?&quot;<br />
O&rsquo;Magosh then noted;<br />
&ldquo;You were never a nominee,<br />
And none of us have voted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;KNOCK spell,&rdquo; John said proudly,<br />
with self possessing glee,<br />
&ldquo;Fire trap! Save!&rdquo; the GM noted,<br />
&ldquo;or take 4D6 plus three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m immune to magic fire,&rdquo; said John,<br />
&ldquo;and any Magic you can Name!&quot;<br />
Thereby leaching for the players<br />
all the reason from the Game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolomite!&rdquo; the Dwarf then said,<br />
his jaw was tight and grim,<br />
He dutifully noted<br />
what Dorkus&rsquo; spell cost him.</p>
<p>A smile of Impish triumph<br />
on John&rsquo;s young visage shown,<br />
As he tracked the hit points lost<br />
on all characters (save his own).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roll the save against NORMAL fire,<br />
and spare the angry cries.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;I saved!&rdquo; was Dorkus&rsquo; sharp retort,<br />
while still looking for his dice.</p>
<p>John found his die and cast it,<br />
&ldquo;Eighteen, I saved, it&rsquo;s true!&quot;<br />
Cutter glanced at the D20,<br />
the die clearly showed a two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hefty saving bonus,&quot;<br />
Cutter said with rising tension.<br />
&ldquo;An owlbear&rsquo;s clawing at the elf,&quot;<br />
the GM thought to mention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owlbears?!?&rdquo; was their joint reply,<br />
&ldquo;Five!&rdquo; said the GM with elan,<br />
&ldquo;They rushed out when Dorkus blew the door,&quot;<br />
all eyes were turned to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should get the initiative,&rdquo; John argued,<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is fair!&quot;<br />
&ldquo;They heard Dorkus shouting in the hall,<br />
that&rsquo;s how they <u>knew</u> you were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The GM went on through the melee<br />
for each monster and player in turn,<br />
Giving John about ten minutes<br />
to sit and think and burn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them they can&rsquo;t mess with me,&quot;<br />
John thought on it a while,<br />
An idea came into his mind,<br />
and his lips curled with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Owlbears can not hurt me,<br />
my armor is too tough.<br />
So I&rsquo;ll let the Owlbears kill these guys,<br />
then take their magic stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when Dorkus&rsquo; turn came &lsquo;round,<br />
John&rsquo;s smiling face went bland,<br />
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s confused, so it&rsquo;ll take another round<br />
to throw the spell I planned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight went on another round,<br />
as hit points drained away,<br />
&ldquo;I hit an Owlbear with my staff,&quot;<br />
was all John thought to say.</p>
<p>The Elven Ranger took a swing,<br />
his aim was good and true,<br />
&ldquo;A critical hit,&rdquo; the GM said,<br />
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all for Owlbear Two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About time you did something good,&quot;<br />
the Mage said to the Elf;<br />
&ldquo;Or else I&rsquo;d have to throw a spell,<br />
and do the job myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be nice,&rdquo; the Ranger&rsquo;s player sighed,<br />
&ldquo;with half the party dead.&quot;<br />
Owlbears pound with cruel violence<br />
on the Dwarven Warrior&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolomite!&rdquo; Mighty Cutter thought,<br />
&ldquo;things is lookin&rsquo; grim.&quot;<br />
He bit an Owlbear with his axe,<br />
the Owlbear, then, bit him.</p>
<p>The Cleric called upon her Gods,<br />
and cast the spells she could.<br />
But since most of her spells were healings,<br />
she wasn&rsquo;t doing very good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is Dorkus going to do?&quot;<br />
and all waited for John to tell,<br />
He thought&quot;I&rsquo;ll show you guys,&rdquo; but then he said:<br />
&ldquo;Dorkus casts a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approval shown in all their eyes,<br />
for Dork would join the war.<br />
He said dramatically:&ldquo;Dorkus casts<br />
STONE TELL upon the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their jaws all dropped in unison,<br />
&ldquo;Say What!&rdquo; was their reply,<br />
Beneath her breath the Cleric said:<br />
&ldquo;Gods, this Mage has <u>got</u> to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you turn on me, I can kill you all!&quot;<br />
the lone magician said;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; the GM noted,<br />
&ldquo;and the Dwarven Warrior&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of knowing finality<br />
passed, unseen, by John,<br />
He said to all:&ldquo;It served him right!&quot;<br />
and bade the game go on.</p>
<p>The Cleric grabbed the fallen Dwarf,<br />
then grasped the Elven Ranger<br />
While she worried the Owlbears with her sword,<br />
to ward off further danger.</p>
<p>Dorkus saw what was happening,<br />
which peaked the angry mage:<br />
&ldquo;Take a shot of&quot;Finger of Death&rsquo;&quot;<br />
John shouted in Dorkus&rsquo; rage.</p>
<p>The Cleric passed the GM a note<br />
which said&quot;Word of Recall.&quot;<br />
And a flash of clerical magic left<br />
Dorkus (and Owlbears) standing in the Hall.</p>
<p>The GM fixed John with an angry stare,<br />
&ldquo;By all the planes of all the Hells,<br />
&lsquo;Finger of Death&rsquo; is <u>Clerical</u>.<br />
Let me see your list of spells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Natural Ability?&rsquo;&rdquo; John said hopefully,<br />
his haughty bluff was plain.<br />
&ldquo;Let me see your character sheet,&quot;<br />
the GM declared again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My . . . ah . . . My spells are in my spell book,<br />
and I don&rsquo;t have it here!&quot;<br />
&ldquo;Since you need it to cast your spells,<br />
you are &lsquo;out of luck&rsquo; I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just make it up again,<br />
as we go on with the game.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;While &lsquo;make up&rsquo; may be the operative words,<br />
it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; the GM noted,<br />
&ldquo;that makes the matter moot,<br />
You cannot cast your magic spells<br />
through your ferrous metal suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I take it off to cast my spells,<br />
the Owlbears will hit me, too.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;Consider that before you make things up,<br />
the choice is up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The GM rolled, the Owlbears attacked,<br />
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve grabbed you with claw and beak.<br />
and they&rsquo;re peeling you from your -12 armor,<br />
even as we speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a &lsquo;God Grant&rsquo;,&rdquo; John said weakly,<br />
&ldquo;against taking off my armor.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t on your character sheet,&quot;<br />
the GM&rsquo;s visage lost all sense of humor.</p>
<p>The GM&rsquo;s face grew stern and cold,<br />
they saw his muscles strain.<br />
They knew the GM wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate<br />
John&rsquo;s BS again.</p>
<p>The GM rolled, the Owlbears peeled,<br />
holding Dorkus on the floor.<br />
But concerning this gruesome melee,<br />
I won&rsquo;t say any more&hellip;</p>
<p>Somewhere in warm taverns<br />
adventurers drink ale<br />
and gather in good humor<br />
to tell this little tale;</p>
<p>Somewhere characters joke and jest<br />
o&rsquo;er the anecdote they tell,<br />
But as for Dorkus (with the Owlbears),<br />
things ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; very well!</p>
